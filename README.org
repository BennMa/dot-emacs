* About
This is my emacs configuration files, I've been using it for more then 5 years.
Before I was using a couple of different files for different functions, And
packages from everywhere. Then changed to use el-get for package manager. Now
I'm using use-package which is amazing for code organizing and lazy loading.

* Structure
| file/folder | description                                                                                |
|-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| conf.d/	 | includes all setting files, like customize-settings.                                              |
| init.d/	 | includes all major configuration files.                                                           |
| lisp/       | 	    includes some custom libraries or packages which can not be installed by package-manager. |

| snippets/   | yassnippet snippets                                                                               |
| themes/     | 	    my personal themes                                                                        |
| init.el     | the entrypoint                                                                                    |

* How to install?
Just clone the repository to somewhere, And create a soft link to ~/.emacs.d,
Then open your emacs, It will automaticlly install all required packages.

I'm using this configuration on Mac & ArchLinux.
